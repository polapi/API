# BitBay Trading API #

###  Connecting with API ###

To connect with API you have to send POST request on address below:

https://bitbay.net/API/Trading/tradingApi.php

Request must have **method** parameter, which calls proper operation. 
Next parameter of each request is **moment** - it is current time in unix timestamp format.
Even though the requested host is _bitbay.net_ responses contain cookies for _market.bitbay.pl_. That is how it is supposed to work, so there's no need to worry. 

### API Keys ###

When you want to call API operation you need authentication key. 
Key generation is in account page, under “**API Keys**” tab

https://bitbay.net/account

Each key consist of 3 properties:

- **public key** : you can see it on keys list, it is used for recognizing user and key
- **secret key** :  this one is visible only after generating; after this operation you cannot see it anywhere. Secret key is used to authenticate user, which calls API operation
- **permissions** : when generating new key you can set permissions for specific operations

### Signing requests ###

POST requests have to be signed by authentication code. 
You have to use secret key for that, which you use to sign parameters with SHA512 algorithm.
It is neccessary to send public key in header as API-Key and also hashed post message as API-Hash.

Example:

```php

        $params["method"] = “info”;    
        $params["moment"] = time();
        $post = http_build_query($params, "", "&");
        $sign = hash_hmac("sha512", $post, $secret);
        $headers = array(
            "API-Key: " . $key,
            "API-Hash: " . $sign,
        );
```

### Moment parameter ###

It is request execution unix timestamp. This value is compared with server time. If difference is bigger than 5 seconds - operation won’t be executed.
It is important to have synchronized time with NTP public time server - in other case server time can differ a lot than time of request machine.

### Example PHP execution code ###

```php
function BitBay_Trading_Api($method, $params = array())
{
    $key = "123";
    $secret = "321";
    
    $params["method"] = $method;        
    $params["moment"] = time();

    $post = http_build_query($params, "", "&");
    $sign = hash_hmac("sha512", $post, $secret);
    $headers = array(
        "API-Key: " . $key,
        "API-Hash: " . $sign,
    );
    $curl = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://bitbay.net/API/Trading/tradingApi.php");
    curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post);
    curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
    $ret = curl_exec($curl);

    return $ret;
}
```

### API call rate limit  ###

#### `history` - history of all user's operations ####

Input:

- **currency** : Abbreviation of a currency name of which history will be displayed.
- **limit** : Maximum number of returned history entries (notice that this time the argument is required). Usually limiting number of returned records makes sense when there's possibility to provide an offset. In this case it's not there, so better hurry up before your history will be unaccessable through API (because you'll have more transactions than maximum limit).

Output:

- **id** : some kind of id
- **amount** : amount of currency in operation
- **balance_after** : total balance after operation (does not contain substracted locked balance)
- **currency** : abbreviation of a currency name i.e. same thing as you provided in request
- **operation_type** : type of operation (e.g. "+currency_transaction"), possible types nobody bothered to list. 
- **time** : operation date in format _yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss_
- **comment** : comment for operation (usually it is not type of operation, because there's seperate field for that)


#### `transactions` - history of user's transactions ####

Input:

- _(optional)_  **market** : (e.g. BTC-USD) if set the result list would be limited to transactions with given currencies. Correct format is cryptoCurrencyShortcut-priceCurrencyShortcut. If parameter not set method returns all transactions ordered by date in descending order.

Output:

- **date** : date of transaction - it's basically the same thing as in **history** endpoint **time** output, but this time it's called **date** 
- **type** : ASK if you sold crypto, BID when you were buyer
- **market** : pair of currencies of transaction
- **amount** : amount of crypto sold/bought
- **rate** : crypto rate used in specified transaction
- **price** : total price paid in transaction

Tips:

Transactions endpoint won't return information about fees. So to get them you will have to match transaction endpoint calls with history calls. Good luck with that!
